## 1. Description  
I started this project with the idea the goof around with the technos we learn at BeCode. The starting idea is to create a mock-up of the first 8-bit Zelda game using css and let it evolve with the new stuff we learn along the way.  
I first though of it as a personal pet project, but on second thought it seemed more interesting, fun- and learning-wise to try and make it a group project.  

## 2. Objectives  
* Explore the possibilities of the technos learned at BeCode in a fun oriented setting
* Use collaborative tools like Git and Ryver
* Learn to work collaboratively on a project in a pressure-free, yet concrete setting
* Have fun

## 3. House rules  
* Try and use the technos in a way that is not what they're primarily supposed to do (ex: make a css game)
* **Only use technos that we have learned together at BeCode**. This ensures that everyone can work on everything at everytime. If you want to explore other possibilities, start a branch and wait for the others to catchup.
* Don't `push` on `master` without checking out with the group first.
* Keep in mind that the goal is to _explore and have fun_, *not* to create the next God of War

## 4. How to join  
* Be a member of Lovelace-2 (at least for now)
* Contact me on Ryver to be added to the group
* `clone` this repo
* Create a branch
* Start goofing around

## 5. Collabolators
